# 最前面画像ミギシタ ／ MostFrontPictureMigishita

You can display a picture like Picture-in-Picture.

If you speak Japanese, please read [Japanese version](./README.md)


## Overview and Usage

You can display any image you want in any location and in any size, like a picture-in-picture at the most front. In addition, it supports video as well, and has a sleep and screen-off prevention function (you can also use it to hide images and temporarily prevent screen-off). The following is what I’m assuming, but there may be other uses.

- You want the image of your favorite charactor to always appear on the screen.
- You want to work with images such as memos displayed.
- To temporarily prevent the screen from being turned off (for presentations, live broadcasts, etc.)


## Cautions

I made this program when I was still a beginner in programming. I thinked of releasing it to the public after making it more beautiful and functional, but it was forgotten for 3 or 4 years, and it would not be good for me or others if I kept, so I decided to open-source it.

So, please understand that the source code may be messy and there may be some bugs.

I will continue to add features when I feel like it, but I don’t plan to make any major changes to the original code.


## Requirements

- **OS**：Windows 10
	- it works on 1507 and later (so, all Windows 10), but please use the supported OS version (about 1.5 years).
	- it doesn’t work on macOS.
		- I’d like to make it Mac compatible, but since it uses a lot of Windows features, I’ll have to rewrite it.
- **Architecture**：AMD64
	- 32-bit processors and ARM processors are not supported.
- **Others**：I think it will work on any PC that meets the requirements of Windows 10.


## How to Download & Launch

I have not made an installer.

I think [Releases](https://github.com/SKAsApp/MostFrontPictureMigishita/releases) has a Zip file （最前面画像ミギシタ.zip） with all the executable files, so save it anywhere you want, extract it, and run “最前面画像ミギシタ.exe”.

In the future, we plan to release it on Microsoft Store.


## Future Plans

- Solving the problem of videos not playing
- Add the following to the screen-off prevention function
	- audio link
	- Prevent sleep only (the screen can be turned off)
